React Lights Out

Project Description
React Lights Out is a web-based version of the classic Lights Out game, built using React. The goal of the game is to turn off all the lights on the grid by clicking on them. Clicking a 
light toggles it and its adjacent lights. The game is a fun way to practice React components, state management, and handling user interactions.
